# Welcome to D. Akman's Tutorials on Data Science with Python!

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to help you learn the following:
- Fundamental concepts of Python programming together with Pythonâ€™s Data Science stack
- Introductory statistics with Python
- Basic concepts to advanced techniques in machine learning with Python

These notebooks were written by yours truly, David Akman, and are my own work for the most part. They have been tested with Python 3.11.

Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/akmand) for more information.
